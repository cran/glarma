2013-12-16    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* many small changes to documentation mainly to fix values
	returned and descriptions. Worked with William at UNSW to complete
	changes and submit to CRAN

2013-11-18    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* summary.glarma, print.summary.glarma, print.glarma all changed
	to take the null deviance and degrees of freedom found by initial
	and use it when printing the glarma fit and summary

	* initial changed so that the GLM with an intercept is also
	fitted and usual null deviance and null df are extracted from it
	and returned by initial

2013-11-15    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* OxBoatRace.Rd, RobberyConvict.Rd examples changed so that glm
	model is fitted with an intercept, so null degrees of freedom are
	number of observations -1

2013-11-14  David  <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* summary.glarma changed to fix problem with degrees of freedom
	calculation. Previous calculation used length() but this fails for
	binomial when a matrix is supplied. Changed from using length() to
	using NROW.

	* print.glarma also changed to fix degrees of freedom

2013-11-13    <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* summmary.glarma and print.summmary.glarma argument testings
	changed to tests

	* print.summmary.glarma changed to put tests at the end and
	specify null and alternative hypotheses.

2013-11-12  David  <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* glarma.Rd altered to ensure no examples take more than 5secs
	which is a CRAN requirement.

	I set the polio grad values to 1e-6 in glarma, moved the other
	examples to the data help files (Asthma, OxBoatRace and
	RobberyConvict). There was still a problem with Asthma, which
	already had grad values of 1e-6. I cut the Newton-Raphson example,
	just left Fisher scoring, and put the negative binomial as
	\dontrun. I put a note on the negative binomial to say it was
	\dontrun only because of timing for acceptance on CRAN. I also put
	some pointers to the other examples in \seealso in glarma.

2013-11-11  Ethan  <cli113@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

	* added the null deviance into the glarma object, and it is also
	into the print method of the glarma object.

	* added the null deviance and the residual deviance into the print
	method of the summary.glarma object, they are shown with their
	degrees of freedom at the bottom of the summary table.

2013-11-03  Ethan  <cli113@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

	* changed the functions for control flow in deltaGen, phiGen and
	thetaGen. They were originally controlled by is.null(), they are
	replaced by missing(). The the default settings for arguments
	phiLags, phiInit, thetaLags, thetaInit, alphaInit and beta in
	glarma() are no longer NULL, but missing statement due to this
	change of control flow functions.

2013-11-01  David  <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* fitted.glarma replaced by a standard fitted
	function. fitted.values added to the list of objects returned by
	all the glarma fitting functions. Actually fitted.glarma is now
	redundant---fitted.default could be used as it is by glm and
	lm. However, I have kept it in. Also mu and fitted.values returned
	by the fitting functions are exactly the same, so only one is
	needed, which should be fitted.values, but I have also kept mu.

2013-10-31  David  <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* glarmaPredProb changed for object$type == "Bin". Value of pi was
	incorrectly calculated. Should be exp(W)/(1 + exp(W)). The
	accessor function fitted.glarma needs checking, particularly its
	default values.

2013-10-31  David  <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* qqPIT changed argument from intervals to bins to agree with
	histPIT.

	* likeTests defined as a synonym for likTests.

2013-10-30  Ethan  <cli113@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

	* revised glarma.Rd for the explanation of the argument y.

	* modified mySolve.R. In mySolve(), is.matrix() was originally
	used to detect the uninvertible matrix, but it actually failed to
	do so, as the inverse of the uninvertible matrix was still in
	matrix form; therefore, is.matrix() could not be used to do the
	control flow. It is now replaced with is.na() to see if there is
	any number in the matrix that is NA or NaN.

	* added a warning message into glarma() in glarma.R to help users
	identify the situation that the model fitting is not able to
	converge.

	* added PIT.R, it is the methods of generating PIT for the glarma
	object. It includes the function glarmaPredProb(), glarmaPIT(),
	histPIT() and qqPIT().

	* added PIT.Rd and plotPIT.Rd, they are the documentations for the
	PIT methods.

	* modified plot.glarma() by adding two PIT plots, PIT histogram
	and uniform Q-Q plot for PIT. The corresponding arugments for
	controling these two plot have been added into plot.glarma()

	* revised plot.glarma.Rd for the inclusion the PIT plots.

2013-10-09  David <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* revised all .Rd files, except plot.glarma.Rd which requires the
	addition of PIT plots.

2013-10-07  David <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* likeTests changed to likTests for consistency with logLik. See
	also the use of print.likTests below. Also some minor changes to
	print methods (adding "\n" in some places).

2013-09-10  David <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* RUnit testing capability added. Involves adding directories
	tests, inst, and inst/unitTests. The approach used is the one
	described on the R-Wiki:
	http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:runit

2013-08-30  Ethan  <cli113@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

	* print.likTests.R added. It is the print method for likeTests, it
	would present the tests with P-value as a matrix. Also, it would
	come up with the significant star to help identify whether the
	tests are significant.

2013-08-27  David  <d.scott@auckland.ac.nz>

	* revised all .Rd files, changed names of data sets to start with
	upper case letter, renamed all R files to have extension .R

2013-08-18  Ethan  <cli113@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

	* plot.glarma.Rd has been created, the manual about how to use
	this S3 generic function has been set up.

2013-08-15  Ethan  <cli113@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

	* plot.glarma.R added. It is a S3 generic plot method.

2013-08-07  Ethan  <cli113@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

	* glarma.R changed. The names of the returns for delta, ll, ll.d,
	ll.dd, e, philags, thetalags, Y, Residtype and ErrCode are changed
	to coefficients, logLik, logLikDeriv, logLikDeriv2, residuals,
	phiLags, thetaLags, y, residType and errCode respectively.

	Also,the returns were originally stored in a two levels list.
	i.e. glarmaMod$fit$aic. It has been adjusted to one level
	list. i.e. glarma$aic.

	* accessors.R added. They are the accessor functions that are used
	to extract the returns from the glarma object. They are all S3
	generic fucntions. File includes functions coef.glarma,
	fitted.glarma, residuals.glarma, logLik.glarma, nobs.glarma,
	model.frame.glarma and extractAIC.glarma.

	* The documentations for the functions in the accessors.R have
	been created.

2013-07-29  Ethan  <cli113@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

        * cleaned up all .R file, and make them all into google style.

	* paramGeneration.R added. They are the functions that are used to
	create the vector of initial theta, phi and delta
	automatically. File includes functions thetaGen, phiGen and
	deltaGen.

	* paramGeneration.Rd created.

	* glarma.R changed and arguments phiInit, thetaInit, beta,
	alpha.init and alpha are added. Functions in paramGeneration.R are
	added into the function "glarma". The users would not need to
	create the initial vector theta, phi and delta by themselves right
	now, they could just put the neccessary information into the
	glarma function, the delta would be created automatically.

	* summary.glarma.R added. They are the summary method and the
	print method for summary.glarma. File includes functions
	summary.glarma and print.summary.glarma.
