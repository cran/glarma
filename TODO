Consider possible change to initial() so that glm model is not fitted
without an intercept. This is so the null degrees of freedom will be
number of observations - 1, rather than number of observations. Then
initial() will also return this null degrees of freedom for use by
print.glarma and print.summary.glarma

Change glarma to accept formula glm component
