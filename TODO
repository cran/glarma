glarma with no ARMA component returns the same estimates as glm, and
the same AIC value, but different null and residual deviances. Needs
to be fixed. Example is in tests/offsetTest.R.

--------------------------------------------

extractAIC.glarma should perhaps be changed, to return the equivalent
degrees of freedom and the AIC as for extractAIC.glm. That would give
consistency.

--------------------------------------------

add na.action to models, and napredict in fitted and predict methods?

---------------------------------------------


Consider possible change to initial() so that glm model is not fitted
without an intercept. This is so the null degrees of freedom will be
number of observations - 1, rather than number of observations. Then
initial() will also return this null degrees of freedom for use by
print.glarma and print.summary.glarma

Change glarma to accept formula glm component

Change e.d, e.dd in binomial identity residuals program to have -
(minus sign) inserted after = (equal) sign. Recorded 24/4/14 by WD
from Jieyi's report.

Replace
e.d[, tmpq] <- n.trial[time] * pt * (1 - pt) * W.d[, tmpq]
by
e.d[, tmpq] <- - n.trial[time] * pt * (1 - pt) * W.d[, tmpq]
and replace
e.dd[, , tmpq] <- n.trial[time] * pt * (1 - pt) * ((1 - 2 * pt) *
                              W.d[, tmpq] %o% W.d[, tmpq] + W.dd[, , tmpq])
by
e.dd[, , tmpq] <- - n.trial[time] * pt * (1 - pt) * ((1 - 2 * pt) *
                              W.d[, tmpq] %o% W.d[, tmpq] + W.dd[, , tmpq])
______________________________________________________________________________
In Binary Score residuals replace
e.dd[, , tmpq] <- e.dd[, , tmpq] <- (-2 * pt + 1 + pt *
by
e.dd[, , tmpq] <- e.dd[, , tmpq] <- (-2 * pt + 1 + pt^2 * [square of pt]

Notes on na.action as used in glm

na.action is an S3 generic with a single method, na.action.default
Takes value from the na.action list element from an object, or from
the na.action attribute of an object.

From ?na.exclude, we probably want to use na.exclude along with
nasresid and napredict so that our plotting functions don't fall
over. There is also na.contiguous to consider because of time series.

The modeling functions will need to have an na.action argument
added. They will need to return an na.action element as well.
