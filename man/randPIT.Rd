\title{
  Random normal probability integral transformation
}
\description{
  Function to create the normalized conditional (randomized) quantile
  residuals.

\usage{
normRandPIT(object)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{an object of class "glarma"}
}
\details{
  The function \code{\link{glarmaPredProb}} produces the non-randomized
  probability integral transformation (PIT). It returns estimates of the
  cumulative predictive probabilities as upper and lower bounds of a
  collection of intervals. If the model is correct, a histogram drawn
  using these estimated probabilities should resemble a histogram
  obtained from a sample from the uniform distribution. This function
  aims to produce observations which instead resemble a sample from a
  normal distribution. Such a sample can then be examined by the usual
  tools for checking normality, such as histograms, Q-Q normal plots and
  for checking independence, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation
  plots, and associated portmanteau statistics.

  For each of the intervals produced by \code{\link{glarmaPredProb}}, a
  random uniform observation is generated, which is then converted to a
  normal observation by applying the inverse standard normal
  distribution function (that is \code{\link{qnorm}}). The vector of
  these values is returned by the function in the list element
  \code{rt}. In addition non-random observations which should appear
  similar to a sample from a normal distribution are obtained by
  applying \code{qnorm} to the mid-points of the predictive distribution
  intervals. The vector of these values is returned by the function in
  the list element \code{rtMid}.
